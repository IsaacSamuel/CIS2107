#Homework 1

You learned getchar() and EOF in the class. You use them in an example to count the number of digits from input1. Extend2 that C program, so it will count the number of various individual  English alphabets (both lowercase and uppercase). Also, count the total number of characters. 

You program should prints these: 

-count of each individual digit (0-9) 

-count of each individual  alphabet letter (a-z and A-Z) 

-total count of any kind of characters 

-So basically the output will be the values stored in (10+26+26+1=) 63 counter.
