#Homework and labs for Computer Systems and Low-Level Programming, CIS 2107

These are the homeworks and labs for CIS 2107 at Temple University with Dr. Shahram Mohrekesh. Taken Spring 2017.

These are posted on github primarily for my own convenience. If you are in the class, please feel free to use them as a reference if you are stuck. I know that his class in particular causes students a lot of problems. That said, please don't download these to submit them as your own. I promise that you will fail the exams if you do that. Also, you'll be super lame.
